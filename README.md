# eyesocket

A platform to freely express yourself without consequence

This client/server bundle is designed to create a space where you can speak your mind freely.

# yarn link

This is a required step before running the client or server.

Inside the `/common/` directory, do `yarn link`. Inside of the both the `/server/` and `/client/` directory,
do `yarn link "common"`. This links the common directory to both projects.
